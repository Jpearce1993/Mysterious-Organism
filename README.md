Executable: main.js


Small script that primarily mass produces a single object for comparison.

This script begins with given function that randomizes a DNA sequence of 15 strands for the objects.
The script simulates a organism that can change its DNA sequence and based on a certain DNA sequence percentage, has a high survivability rate.

This script can:
	- Compare one organism with another and determine the percentage of similiar DNA.
	- Check the survivability rate of a organism based on the DNA sequence.
	- Create an complementary DNA strand of the organism (Reverse the DNA sequence, A = T, C = G, etc.).
	- Mass produce organisms that will have a acceptable survivability rate.
